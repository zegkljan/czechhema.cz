In&nbsp;cooperation with HVN (Netherlands) and EHMS (Finland), we&nbsp;are&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;invite you to&nbsp;our first international beginner-and-basic level longsword tournament - BOHEMA*: First Harvest.

On&nbsp;September 7 and 8, in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;Prague, Czech Republic.

Our clubs plan this event to&nbsp;create an entry-level friendly environment where students from all over Europe can meet their peers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big, exciting event and fight, fight, fight! We have NO CAP on&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;participants.

But who are the beginners and regulars? It is up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the instructors to&nbsp;decide. We can tell you who are not: people who have won medals in&nbsp;beginner, open, or&nbsp;advanced competitions. We will have open and advanced events later for you.

What about women, is the tournament mixed? Yes, it is. And there are no beginner restrictions for women fencers. Please, come and fight as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you want. We need more of&nbsp;you in&nbsp;HEMA.

On&nbsp;Saturday - The Tournament.  
Large pools of&nbsp;7 fencers, everyone goes to&nbsp;eliminations, final pools, and unlimited sparrings on&nbsp;both days of&nbsp;the event. You will probably have some of&nbsp;the best judging possible with all instructors judging the fights.

On&nbsp;Sunday - Sparring Games.  
Spar as&nbsp;long and as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you can with instructors and other students. Participate in&nbsp;different sparring games until you faint from exhaustion, including epic King of&nbsp;the Boars event!

Epic Location:  
We have booked the modern, stellar, slick, and comfortable Repy Arena for&nbsp;the event. A&nbsp;cafe with fresh meals and a&nbsp;hotel with a&nbsp;sauna and swimming pools will be at&nbsp;your service. If you get a&nbsp;hotel room there, the tournament hall will be just a&nbsp;1-minute lazy walk from your bed. And yes, we'll have pool party with sauna after the event üòâ

Help with equipment:  
If, as&nbsp;sometimes happens with beginners, you lack any equipment, we will provide it.


All swords will be provided by Kvetun Armoury.
